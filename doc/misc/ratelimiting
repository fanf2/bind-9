----------------------

Configuration parameters are as follows. These are per-view parameters.

ratelimit-table-size number
ratelimit-hash-count number
ratelimit-log number
ratelimit-truncate number
ratelimit-drop number

The rate measurement code is in isc/bloomrate.[ch] and the limits are
handled by bin/named.
