Notes on rate limiting
----------------------

The reference for this work is "network applications of Bloom filters"
by Andrei Broder and Michael Mitzenmacher.
http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~michaelm/postscripts/im2005b.pdf

The specific technique for measuring each client's rate is described
in section 8.1.

Also worth noting is "less hashing, same performance"
by Adam Kirsch and Michael Mitzenmacher
http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~kirsch/pubs/bbbf/esa06.pdf
which shows that Bloom filters work just as well with a linear
combination of two independent hashes as they do with multiple
independent hashes.

Configuration parameters:

ratelimit-table-size number
ratelimit-hash-count number
ratelimit-log number
ratelimit-truncate number
ratelimit-drop number

Cleaning interval is a fixed value
Calculate ageing parameter from limits and interval.
