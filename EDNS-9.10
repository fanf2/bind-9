			EDNS in BIND 9.10

The EDNS code in BIND 9.10 records successful plain and EDNS query
counts as well at timeouts for plain DNS and EDNS queries at various
EDNS buffer sizes: 4096, 1432, 1232 and 512 for each server named
talks to.  A EDNS timeout for a lower buffer size is also counted
against higher buffer sizes.  These are held in 8 bit counters and
are shifted on overflow of any counter.  This will result in false
positives due to transitory network problems to be removed from the
history.

The buffer sizes of 1432 and 1232 are choosen to allow for a IPv4/IPv6
encapsulated UDP message to be sent without fragmentation at Ethernet
and IPv6 network mimimum MTU sizes.

Named also records the largest successful EDNS response size seen.

When talking to a new server named will send a EDNS query advertising
a 512 byte UDP buffer.  This is the most conservative EDNS message
that can be sent.  If this results in a response with TC=1 being
sent a larger EDNS buffer size will be used rather than a immediate
fallback to TCP.

If there are too many timeouts to EDNS queries without a successful EDNS
query and with successful plain DNS queries named will fallback to using
plain DNS when taking to a server.  Named will periodically send a EDNS
query to see if the server now supports EDNS.

When talking to a server using EDNS named will choose a EDNS buffer size
based on the history of EDNS timeouts at various advertised sizes.
